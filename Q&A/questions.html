Even little things can make a big difference in someone's day. Plus, researchers have found that performing acts of kindness make people feel happier.</p>

                <p>You can't be present and your best self if you’re constantly asking yourself questions such as:  Did they think that I was smart? Did they think that I was successful? Did they think what I said was stupid? In truth, you can never really know what someone else thinks of you. So, instead of worrying about it, be your most confident self and concentrate on what you want to communicate, ask good questions and look people in the eyes.</p>
